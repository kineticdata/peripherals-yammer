== Yammer User Invite
This handler invites a user to your Yammer network.

=== Parameters
[User Email]
  The email address of the user that should be invited.

=== Results
This handler returns no results.

==== Sample Configuration
User Email:                 new.user@acme.com

=== Detailed Description
This handler invites a user to your Yammer network.  If the inputted access token
belongs to a verified admin in a paid Yammer network, external email domains
can be included. If not, only email addresses for official company domains will
be allowed.  Any errors that happen during this process will be caught and
re-raised by the handler.

Note: This handler requires a verified admin account in a paid Yammer network!
(If you are an admin and still getting an error with the message "Attempt to
access a protected resource failed" make sure that you are also verified.)

===How to retrieve your Access Token
* These instructions can also be found on developer.yammer.com/authentication
under client-side authentication
  1. Start by creating a client application at https://www.yammer.com/client_applications
  2. Fill in the required information and create the application
  3. Using the client id you retrieved from the application, paste this url into
     your browser, making sure to replace [:client_id]:
     - https://www.yammer.com/dialog/oauth?client_id=[:client_id]&redirect_uri=127.0.0.1&response_type=token
  4. After submitting that page and authorizing the application, look in the url
     to find your access token. That url will look like:
