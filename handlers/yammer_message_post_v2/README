== Yammer Message Post
This handler posts a new message on Yammer

=== Parameters
[Message]
  The message that you want to post to Yammer.
[Group Name]
  The name of the group that the message should be posted to (leave blank if
  posting to main network page).

=== Results
This handler returns no results.

==== Sample Configuration
Message:                 This is a test message
Group Name:              Testing Group

=== Detailed Description
This handler posts a new message to the domain that the inputted access token
(as an info value) is tied to. If you want to post to a specific Group, input the
group name and the handler will automatically find the group id using an extra
REST call, which is needed to post to a specific group. Any errors that happen
in this process will be caught and re-raised by the handler.

===How to retrieve your Access Token
* These instructions can also be found on developer.yammer.com/authentication
under client-side authentication
  1. Start by creating a client application at https://www.yammer.com/client_applications
  2. Fill in the required information and create the application
  3. Using the client id you retrieved from the application, paste this url into
     your browser, making sure to replace [:client_id]:
     - https://www.yammer.com/dialog/oauth?client_id=[:client_id]&redirect_uri=127.0.0.1&response_type=token
  4. After submitting that page and authorizing the application, look in the url
     to find your access token. That url will look like:
     - https://www.yammer.com127.0.0.1/#access_token=[:access_token]
  5. Paste this Access Token into your info values and you will be all set!
